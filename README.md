# OSGi enRoute Examples

This is a repository that illustrates the [OSGi enRoute Service Catalog][enroute.services] with example application. Each project in this repository is a stand-alone OSGi enRoute application that exercises _the user of_ a particular service. In general, you can start the debug.bndrun in each project in debug and go to http://localhost:8080/<project-name>. Each project has a readme.md that will give you more details of what the application demonstrates. The applications themselves are also self documenting (at least that is the intent).

This repository is open source under ASL 2.0. Please provide pull requests if you see improvements.
